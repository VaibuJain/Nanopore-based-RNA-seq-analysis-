# Liver Cancer Analysis

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of liver cancer data using computational and statistical methods. The project is implemented in Python as a Jupyter Notebook (`liver_cancer_analysis.ipynb`) and includes steps for preprocessing, visualization, and biological insights.

## Features

- Qality checking and triming.
- Alignment with reference genome.
- postalignment.
- Differential gene expression analysis.
- Pathway enrichment and functional analysis.

## Files

- `liver_cancer_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook for liver cancer analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing raw and processed datasets (not included, add your data here).
- `results/`: Folder for saving analysis outputs, plots, and results (generated during execution).

## Requirements

To run this analysis, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`
- `statsmodels`
- `sklearn`
- `bioinfokit` (for enrichment analysis)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels scikit-learn bioinfokit
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liver-cancer-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository:
```bash
cd liver-cancer-analysis
```

3. Add your dataset to the `data/` folder.

4. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook liver_cancer_analysis.ipynb
```

5. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Outputs

- Visualizations of differentially expressed genes and pathways.
- Lists of significant genes and associated enzymatic activities.
- Enrichment analysis results for biological pathways and molecular functions.
